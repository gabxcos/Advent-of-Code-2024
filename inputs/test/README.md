# About sharing sample puzzle inputs

This folder will be used for defining sample puzzle inputs to test the code against, before computing the final solutions.

Each day, a single sample input is generated for both parts' puzzles, and shared in the middle of the first part's puzzle description.

Although using these sample inputs locally to test your code is allowed, sharing them publicly outside of [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)'s website [is not](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/zdz8qa/license_of_the_input_data/).

In order to be able to test your code for a specific day's sample input after cloning this repository in local, you need to copy it from the website and pasting it inside a plaintext file in this folder.

The expected naming convention for these files is simply the zero-padded version of the day's number.

So, day `1`'s sample input will go inside a plaintext named `01`, and day `25`'s will go inside the file named `25`.
