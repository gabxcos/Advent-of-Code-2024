# About sharing personal puzzle inputs

This folder will be used for defining personal puzzle inputs to test the code against, in order to compute the final solutions.

Each day, a single personal input is generated for both parts' puzzles, and shared at a given endpoint returning the personalized input for each user.

Although using these personal inputs locally to test your code is allowed, sharing them publicly outside of [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)'s website [is not](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/zdz8qa/license_of_the_input_data/).

In order to be able to test your code for a specific day's personal input after cloning this repository in local, you need to copy it from the website and pasting it inside a plaintext file in this folder.

The expected naming convention for these files is simply the zero-padded version of the day's number.

So, day `1`'s personal input will go inside a plaintext named `01`, and day `25`'s will go inside the file named `25`.
